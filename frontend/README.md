I have analyzed your existing routes (`login`, `signup`, and `dashboard`) and have created the following new routes, each with a placeholder `+page.svelte` file:

- `/schedule`
- `/tasks`
- `/insight`
- `/health`
- `/setting`

The development server should have automatically detected these new pages. You can navigate to them in your browser to see the new routes.
